### Practices

Check your repository for using the correct tooling which improves product development.

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

We have more than 10 JS/TS practices for now! If you want to add more, you are more than welcome. Check [JavaScript Practices](https://github.com/DXHeroes/dx-scanner/tree/master/src/practices/JavaScript) to see what is the pattern of implementation of your own practice.

#### Other Languages

Other languages are not supported yet. If you want to contribute, see [Practices](https://github.com/DXHeroes/dx-scanner/tree/master/src/practices). Get inspired by [Javascript Practices](https://github.com/DXHeroes/dx-scanner/tree/master/src/practices/JavaScript) implementation.

### Inspectors

Inspectors indirectly work with Git code hosting providers APIs. They use common interfaces provided by services so you do not have to know which API to use.

### Services

There is a [File System Service](https://github.com/DXHeroes/dx-scanner/tree/master/src/services) working with files.

#### Git

Services directly use Git code hosting providers APIs while checking the rate limits. They convert API responses to their own interface so Inspectors can use them. Only the GitHub Service is implemented so far. If you need for example, GitLab Service, you can contribute! Get inspired by [GitHub Service](https://github.com/DXHeroes/dx-scanner/blob/master/src/services/git/GitHubService.ts)
